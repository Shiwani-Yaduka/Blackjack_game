Blackjack is a popular casino banking game played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. Here's a step-by-step guide to play Blackjack:

Starting the Game:

1. Place a bet in the designated betting area.
2. Receive two cards, face up.
3. The dealer receives one card, face up (upcard), and one card, face down (hole card).

Card Values:

- Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which is more beneficial to your hand.

Gameplay:

1. Hit: Take an additional card from the deck to try to get closer to 21 or beat the dealer's hand.
2. Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
3. Double Down: Double your initial bet and receive one more card. You cannot hit again after doubling down.
4. Split: If your initial two cards have the same value, split them into two separate hands. You'll need to place a second bet, equal to your initial bet.

Winning and Losing:

- If your hand value exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose your bet.
- If the dealer busts, you win.
- If your hand value is higher than the dealer's, you win even money (1:1) on your bet.
- If your hand value is the same as the dealer's, the result is a "push," and your bet is returned.

Additional Rules:

- Insurance: If the dealer's upcard is an Ace, you can place a side bet (insurance) that they have a Blackjack (Ace and a 10-point card). If they do, you'll receive a 2:1 payout on your insurance bet.
- Blackjack: If your initial two cards are an Ace and a 10-point card, you have a Blackjack and win a 3:2 payout on your bet (unless the dealer also has a Blackjack).

Remember, the key to playing Blackjack is to know when to hit, stand, double down, or split, based on your hand value and the dealer's upcard. Good luck!
